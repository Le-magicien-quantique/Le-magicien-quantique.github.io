I participated to the research curriculum which allowed me to take the time to work on adversarial attacks on graph neural networks and model poisoning (CNN).",

As I discovered AI security a bit earlier, I knew the best place for me was in the AI field: with loads of mathematics everywhere. And I can still create and destroy things! And there is also physics! And there are also graphs! That is why I am currently in a gap year, so I can tryhard mathematics and AI before my PhD.",
