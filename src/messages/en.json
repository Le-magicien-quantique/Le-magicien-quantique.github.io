Even though T√©l√©com SudParis offers general scientific courses in mathematics and physics, there is a focus on telecommunication sciences (information theory, signal theory with our best friend Fourier, graph theory, etc.), which is ideal to learn cybersecurity. I participated to the research curriculum which allowed me to take the time to work on adversarial attacks on graph neural networks and model poisoning (CNN). I love graphs. I was also part of the cybersecurity club and the code club.",

I started cybersecurity at T√©l√©com SudParis, where I enjoyed crafting and toying with technology. However, I found that I needed more mathematics in my life. As I discovered AI security a bit earlier, I knew the best place for me was in the AI field: with loads of mathematics everywhere. And I can still create and destroy things! And there is also physics! And there are also graphs! That is why I am currently in a gap year, so I can tryhard mathematics and AI before my PhD.",
